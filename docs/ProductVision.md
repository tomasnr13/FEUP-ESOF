For UP students who need to plan groups, the Uni Workluster is a mobile app that allows the easy creation of groups and overlapping of schedules between students. Unlike SIGARRA, our product has group creation and schedule comparison features while being user and mobile friendly.
Empower Students with the tools for a simpler, faster and better workflow.
