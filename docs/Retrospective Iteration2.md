Link to the release: https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC07T5/releases/tag/v2

- What went well?
The members working on the same issue, worked together, without any problems. The objectives were accomplished.

- What should we do differently?
We should focus on integrating everything that's being developed by the different members

- What still puzzles me?
We think that easy and simple features take a long time to implement because of our need to learn the code already written.
